Extension method — lets you add a method to an existing type (like IServiceCollection) so you can call it as if it were native to that type.

IServiceCollection — a .NET object used at startup to register services into the DI container.

IConfiguration — object that gives access to configuration settings (like connection strings from appsettings.json).

DbContext — Entity Framework Core (EF Core) object that represents the database and lets you query/save data.

UseNpgsql — EF Core method that tells the DbContext to use PostgreSQL as the database engine.

MigrationsAssembly — the assembly (compilation unit) where EF Core will look for migration code (database schema changes).

Scoped lifetime — a service lifetime meaning "one instance per web request" (common for DbContext).
Lifetime: Scoped vs Transient vs Singleton

	Scoped: one instance per request (typical for DbContext).

	Transient: a new instance every time requested.

	Singleton: one instance for the entire application lifetime.

Generic type notation <T> — used to specify types like AddDbContext<CarRentalDbContext>.

Dependency Injection (DI) — a pattern where objects ask a central container for the things they need instead of creating them themselves.
Instead of new CarRentalDbContext() inside your classes, you say in the constructor CarRentalDbContext db and the framework provides it automatically. That makes testing and maintenance easier.
